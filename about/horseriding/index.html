    <p>Please don’t laugh, but I’ve been scared of horse-shaped things since a Blackpool Pleasure Beach donkey bolted with a very young and very terrified Charlie on its back.</p>

<p>Awww, come one. I said don’t laugh.</p>

<p>I say “bolted”, but it I seriously doubt that a donkey went out of control with me on it. I was such a wussy child that it having moved in any way at all probably had me in tears and convinced me that it was trying to kill me.</p>

<p>Knowing as such that I have a fear of all members of the <em>Equus</em> family, you’ll appreciate what a big deal it was for me to walk up to the nearest horse riding centre and ask for a beginners lesson.</p>

<p>I’m still not sure why I did it, but I’m so, so glad that I did.</p>

<p>Since that day in November 2014 I’ve come to love horse riding. I’ve been back every week and have rode multiple horses. At the time of writing, six months have passed and I can now walk, trot (sitting and rising), canter, ride without stirrups in all gaits and jump fences at canter. I can do circles, and serpentines and can control a horse with just my lower body. Amazing progress for six months, from zero-experience, I’m sure you’ll agree.</p>

<p>Riding has been amazing for my mind and for my body, partly because I feel far more connection between my brain and my physical self, and partly because riding is so much more physical work than I ever thought it would be.</p>
