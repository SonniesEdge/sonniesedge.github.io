  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I’m a 30-something woman living in Berlin, Germany (the famous one, with the wall and stuff).</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>If you define me by how I sell my labour, then I’m a front-end web developer, specialising in performance, design systems, architecting beautifully-written Sass and creating sustainable build processes. What does this mean? It means that I’m a developer with an eye for design and who cares for site users. I’m someone who will make sure your site looks amazing and performs fast. I’m someone who will create a beautiful site <em>and</em> beautiful code.</p>

<p>I’m a late entrant into the web game, having only started as a web developer in 2012. But I’ve been in kissing distance of the web and technology for most of my life, while working as a graphics designer in private business and a technology teacher and VLE admin at further education institutions.</p>

<p>I speak at events, write about the web and am generally considered pretty darned good at what I do. I’m currently at Bitcrowd GmbH in Berlin, and was previously at BBC News, where I was responsible for building the 2015 General Election site.</p>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>If you define me as a <em>person</em> and by my life outside work, then I’m a <a href="/about/horseriding">horse riding</a>, <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/sonniesedge">photography-taking</a>, bike riding, beer drinking, feminist leftie; a strawberry-blonde gay woman, with her head always buried in a book.</p>

<p>Oh, and I moved from <a href="/blog/berlin">London to Berlin</a> recently, so check up on that.</p>

<p>Bonus fact: I have voluntary control of my <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle">tensor tympani muscles</a>.</p>

<p>Favourite quote about me: “Well, you do have more than a touch of the German techno-anarchist about you”.</p>
