  </header>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So, I thought it’d be a great idea to write my own CSS framework. This is the kind of thinking that occurs when I’ve had too much caffeine (file this alongside my other caffeine-based projects, such as “Why not repaint the apartment?” and “Try abseiling down an industrial chimney”).</p>

<p>I was inspired by writing an in-house framework for a previous client. It was eventually used on several major projects, but was relatively inflexible, written as it was for one use-case and for a certain way of writing code.</p>

<p>“So,” I thought to myself, “what if I were to write my own, something that could output any type of CSS code, in whatever way the user wanted to use it?”</p>

<p>Think large, and swing hard, you know?</p>

<h1 id="introducing-loom">Introducing Loom</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sonniesedge/loom">Loom</a> is a Sass framework for producing your own pattern libraries. It’s still in alpha, but already it provides a series of OOCSS bricks, mixins, functions and classes that allow you to quickly put together a pattern library of your own, ready to use on a real website. Aimed at professional web developers, it aims to make your life <em>easier</em>.</p>

<p>It’s designed to be light, flexible, modular and just enough opinions to ensure that it runs smoothly.</p>

<h1 id="why-build-something-else">Why build something else?</h1>

<p>Oh, it was partly for the fun, but mainly because I wanted to produce something that was actually <em>useful</em>. Loom doesn’t try to give you pre-made and pre-themed CSS that can be dropped onto a site, the way Zurb Foundation or Twitter Bootstrap libraries do. It gives you a toolkit, a way of making your own pattern libraries. A way to weave your own patterns. Yeah, clever.</p>

<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sonniesedge/loom">Loom</a> is written in Sass and is based upon the ITCSS layered architecture. It uses BEM for its (optional) object and utility classes. It’s deliberately written in a way that discourages Sass nesting and avoids CSS specificity battles, by returning to source order as the way of describing specificity. This makes it perfect for use in multi-developer teams where the threat of “just add a multi-level selector to the end of the stylesheet to make it work” is ever present.</p>

<h1 id="why-use-it">Why use it?</h1>

<p>Dave Rupert nailed it when he said client work was about “<a href="http://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/">producing a series of mini-Bootstraps</a>”. As developer-designers, we should be delivering complete pattern-libraries that describe how a clients site can be used, and which can be used to grow the site styles, get a visually overview and to attach testing.</p>

<p>Loom is grounded in <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-1/">Design System thinking</a> and is aimed at helping you to create your own <a href="http://alistapart.com/blog/post/getting-started-with-pattern-libraries">pattern libraries</a>. This is vital when you’re working on multi-page, multi-author sites, where you don’t get to craft each page artisanally yourself, but instead rely on authors and CMSs to generate a page.</p>

<p>The framework knows about design systems, and so comes pre-equpped with variables, mixins and functions that can be used to extract standard thematic elements for your site. Annoyed by developers using <code class="highlighter-rouge">color: #52BE80</code> in the middle of a class? Well now you can encourage them to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">color: get-color(brand-green)</code> instead, and keep things clean.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-you-use-it">How do you use it?</h1>
<p>There’s two ways of using <a href="https://github.com/sonniesedge/loom">Loom</a>. You can use the (entirely optional) Object and Utility classes to quickly scaffold out a site.</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="nt">&lt;header</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"o-container"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"o-h-alpha u-margin-none"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Good morning humans of Earth<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h2</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"u-color-meta"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>We find you disturbing<span class="nt">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/header&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Or you can use the mixins provided to create your own atomic components and apply them to your HTML. Perfect for creating robust and lasting pattern libraries!</p>

<div class="language-scss highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">.c-header</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">@include</span> <span class="nd">container</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.c-title</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">@include</span> <span class="nd">heading</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="k">@include</span> <span class="nd">font-size</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">alpha</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nl">margin</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.c-meta</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nf">get-color</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">meta</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="nt">&lt;header</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"c-header"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"c-title"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Good morning humans of Earth<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h2</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"c-meta"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>We find you disturbing<span class="nt">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/header&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that Objects are added to Components via <code class="highlighter-rouge">@include</code>, rather than <code class="highlighter-rouge">@extend</code>. This is a conscious choice. <code class="highlighter-rouge">@extend</code> is extremely unpredictable with how it can affect source order, and would undermine the functionality of Loom. <code class="highlighter-rouge">@include</code> introduces a lot of repetition, but this is eliminated when the final CSS is used on a page, as gzip will compress repeated lines of text to nothing.</p>

<h1 id="encouraging-a-common-way-of-working">Encouraging a common way of working</h1>

<p>Loom aims to help your team work together. It’s designed to be used with style linting systems, and to be consumed by automated styleguide generators and regression testing systems.</p>

<p>When you tie in a stylelinting system like <a href="https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint">stylelint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/postcss/postcss-bem-linter">BEM Linter</a> you have an extremely robust system that should catch any code that strays from your house style.</p>

<p>The outputted visual components are perfect for integrating with pattern library documentation systems, such as <a href="http://patternlab.io/">PatternLab</a>.</p>

<h1 id="fully-documented">Fully documented</h1>

<p>Loom is fully documented, using <a href="http://sassdoc.com/">SassDoc</a>. You can look through the included documentation to see what variables, functions and mixins are available out of the box.</p>

<h1 id="take-a-look">Take a look</h1>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/sonniesedge/loom">find Loom on Github</a>. Please feel free to take a look and start trying it out. I’m really happy to hear suggestions and ideas!</p>
