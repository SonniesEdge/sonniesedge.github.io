    <p>I love me some podcasts. I travel everywhere by bicycle and I need something to keep my brain occupied while I do so, so I queue up some podcasts and have them ready to go whenever I get on my bike - my earphones and phone are always in my pocket.</p>

<p>Podcasts are vital for me, as I don’t tend to read blogs or read Twitter that often, so I easily miss out on the latest news and trends in the FED world.</p>

<h2 id="shoptalk-show">Shoptalk show</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">http://shoptalkshow.com/</a></li>
  <li>Presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/davatron5000">Dave Rupert</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chriscoyier">Chris Coyier</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not sure how Dave and Chris manage to churn this show out, but every week a new 1 hour show emerges, and it’s always something to look forward to. Sometimes the shows are centered on special guests and a particular topic, while others are rapid fire shows, where they answer questions on FED tech, process and business sent in by listeners.</p>

<p>It’s always a pleasure to listen to and <em>always</em> informative, and it has been wonderful to see Dave and Chris grow and learn about issues of diversity and intersectionality. When you hear a show that used to feature macho machine-gun noises and dude jokes now ask for show donations to be made to <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a>, you know progress in this industry is possible.</p>

<h2 id="toolsday">Toolsday</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.toolsday.io/">http://www.toolsday.io/</a></li>
  <li>Presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/Una">Una Kravets</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisdhanaraj">Chris Dhanaraj</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’re greeted at the start of every episode by Una singing about FED. This is a <em>good</em> thing. Una and Chris spend each 20 minute show covering topics surrounding the technical side of FED. So one episode might be ES2015, while another might discuss standards and linters. Definitely a good one for getting up to speed on the (sometimes frustratingly) broad topics that make up FED.</p>

<h2 id="ttl">TTL</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ttlpodcast.com/">http://ttlpodcast.com/</a></li>
  <li>Presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/rmurphey">Rebecca Murphey</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve just started listening to this, and I’m already hooked. Between 40 minutes and an hour long, this show has Rebecca talking to a guest about their area of expertise and the work that they do. This results in excellent insider secrets and tips being unearthed in every episode.</p>

<h2 id="style-guide-podcast">Style Guide Podcast</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://styleguides.io/podcast">http://styleguides.io/podcast</a></li>
  <li>Presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/anna_debenham">Anna Debenham</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brad_frost">Brad Frost</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Style Guide Podcast is pretty heavy, dealing with the process and business angles of building and maintaining company-wide style guides. But set aside an hour to listen to the show and you’ll get some valuable insights into maintaining style guides and pattern libraries at scale.</p>

<h2 id="responsive-design-podcast">Responsive Design Podcast</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://responsivedesign.is/podcast">http://responsivedesign.is/podcast</a></li>
  <li>Presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/justinavery">Justin Avery</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming out every 2 - 4 weeks, Justin’s show is a great way of keeping up with trends in the web industry. Each show is highly variable in length and content, but it’s always informative.</p>

<h2 id="percent-invisible">99 Percent Invisible</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/">http://99percentinvisible.org/</a></li>
  <li>Presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/romanmars">Roman Mars</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not actually FED, but this is a podcast that delivers delicious 20 minute chunks about the design that we miss in our everyday lives.</p>

<h2 id="responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/">http://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/</a></li>
  <li>Presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/karenmcgrane">Karen McGrane</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/beep">Ethan Marcotte</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Karen and Ethan spend around 20 minutes each episode talking to the people who make responsive web designs happen. While some of us might take RWD to be a given now, it is still being rolled our in large organisations and in big corporate redesigns. This show gives some great insights into the people and tech processes behind this.</p>

<p>So there you go. Check them out in your podcatcher of choice.</p>

<p>Incidentally, while I’d never try to simultaneously ride a bicycle and listen to anything while cycling in London, because you need 100% of your wits about you due to the Daily Mail-reading, hate-filled, HGV drivers <em>literally</em> trying to kill you, I have no problem doing so in Berlin.</p>

<p>Berlin is, in every aspect bar queueing (where it is 100% German), utterly chill. So while I wait at lights, avoid pedestrians in the cycle lanes, and am busy getting shaken to death on Berlin’s randomly cobbled streets, I probably have one of these shows playing in a solitary ear.</p>
